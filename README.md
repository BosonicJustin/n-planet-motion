# N-Planet Motion Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the motion of N planetary bodies influenced by their mutual gravitational forces. The simulation allows for the visualization of their paths in a 3D space, providing insights into celestial mechanics and the dynamics of multi-body systems.

## Features

- Simulate gravitational interactions between multiple planetary bodies.
- Visualize the motion of planets in a 3D plot.
- Animate the paths of the planets over time.
- Configurable number of planets with random initial positions and masses.

## Requirements

To run the simulation, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
